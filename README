# ft_printf

Implementation of printf funcions in C.

DEVELOPEMENT INFOS: This project is a light-weight version of ft_printf without
the full libft. The libft funcitons needed for ft_printf are located in
src/libft C files with "libft.h" as its header. There is an other version of
ft_printf in libft, that probably will be more up to date than this one. This
one should be updated with the libft version each time it is used.
