# ft\_printf

Implementation of printf functions in C.

## Development

This project is a light-weight version of ft\_printf without the full libft. The
libft functions needed for ft\_printf are located in src/libft C files with
"libft.h" as its header. There is an other version of ft\_printf in libft, that
probably will be more up to date than this one. This one should be updated with
the libft version each time it is used.
